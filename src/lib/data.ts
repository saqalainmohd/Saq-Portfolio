            longDescription: "This research investigates the financial literacy and savings habits of fishermen in Ponnani, focusing on their understanding of budgeting, saving, banking services, insurance, and investment options. The study reveals that most fishermen save less than 10% of their income due to low and inconsistent earnings, seasonal unemployment, and high expenditure on traditional ceremonies. Using primary data collected through questionnaires from 80 respondents, the study employs SPSS for statistical analysis. Key findings highlight the need for Financial Literacy Centres and structured programs to improve financial planning and economic security among marine fishermen.",
